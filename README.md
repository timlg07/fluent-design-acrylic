# Microsoft Fluent Design Acrylic Material


This recreates the _Acrylic_ material which can be found throughout the Windows 10 UI.
It involves multiple layers, including 
 - Background
 - Saturation boost
 - Gaussian blur
 - Exclusion blend
 - Color overlay (currently only white, dark mode coming soon)
 - Tiled noise texture
As you can see in the picture, Microsoft uses the same layers in the same order:
